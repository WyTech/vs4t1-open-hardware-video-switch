To compile, create a project in AVR Studio without an initial file.
Add the existing source file to the project.

The videoswitch.hex and videoswitch.eep are files created by AVRStudio from your code. 
EEP is optional and used if you require use of the EEPROM.

AVR Studio project options must be configured as follows:

In the Project->Configuration general options:
  select ATTiny2313, 8000000 hz, -O0 and check the Create Hex File box.
In the Project->Configuration custom options:
  -Wall, -gdwarf-2, -DF_CPU=8000000UL, -O0, -fsigned-char

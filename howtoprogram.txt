To program the VS4T1 you need to make a cable to interface the RJ45 jack to your ISP.

How to load firmware into the VS4T1
------------------------------------
The VS4T1 uses a custom ISP solution integrated into the RJ45 multi-use port. 
You can adapt this port to your ISP using an IDC 10 pin male connector and a RJ45 connector.
Pinouts for the ISP connection via the RJ45 are:
2 - Reset
3 - Ground
6 - SCK
7 - MOSI
8 - MISO

For USB ISP programmers:
To adapt an ISP programmer to the VS4T1 RJ45 connection, you need to create an adaptor. 
See the ispcable.png diagram file in the hardware folder.

The VS4T1 is then programmed via AVR Studio or via avrdude using the following command:
c:\winavr\bin\avrdude -pt2313 -c avrispv2 -e -U flash:w:videoswitch.hex -U eeprom:w:videoswitch.eep 
                      -U efuse:w:0xff:m -U hfuse:w:0xDB:m -U lfuse:w:0xe4:m

For a parallel port DAPA cable:
To adapt the DAPA cable to the VS4T1 RJ45 connection, you need to create an adaptor. 
Note that DAPA cables are problematic under Win64. Use of USB ISP is recommended.
See the pgmcable.png diagram file in the hardware folder.

The DAPA cable plugs into a IBM PC Parallel port and the device is programmed via avrdude using the following command:
c:\winavr\bin\avrdude -pt2313 -c dapa -e -U flash:w:videoswitch.hex -U eeprom:w:videoswitch.eep 
                      -U efuse:w:0xff:m -U hfuse:w:0xDB:m -U lfuse:w:0xe4:m

You will also need to have a dapa entry in your avrdude config file. 
Current versions should already have this in place. 


The fuse values efuse:w:0xff:m -U hfuse:w:0xDB:m -U lfuse:w:0xe4:m set the following:
- Brown-out detection level at 2.7V BODLEVEL=101
- Int RC Osc 8Mhz 65ms  CKSEL=0100
- Serial program downloading Enabled SPIEN=0

These settings provide best operation for the device and the serial port communications. 
Note that if you adjust the clock speed, you will need to adjust the baud rate examples to proper settings for your new clock speed and data rate.
